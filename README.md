# Militart-Database-Management-System
In this project, we have designed a database management system to store information about the Indian Military. The database will contain important information about the Army and will be accessible to Army Officials and the Government. This database will contain the personal details of the soldiers, posting of soldiers, information about the various battalions of the Army, inventory list and medical supplies of military bases, military vehicles, information about soldiers martyred during the war, awards and honors conferred upon the soldiers for their contributions on and off the battlefield, etc. This database management system will help the Government and the Military Administration to access various types of information quickly and provide resources to the military on time. Assignment of troops to the warfront and formation of special taskforces can be done quickly. They can keep track of the weapons and supplies during wartime and assess how many more weapons will be needed. They can efficiently find soldiers who are currently serving in a particular regiment and also the soldiers who have served in previous operations.
